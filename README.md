# machineLearning

This repo is where I will store sample code for machine learning algorithms. These are very basic examples, but the process of developing the programs is a great way to understand the mechanics of these learning approaches.

The boosting function was written in python and conducts gradient boosting using a one-dimensional spline as the base function. Boosting iteratively fits regression trees to the residuals of the base learner--in this case a spline.

The K-means clustering algorithm was written for R and clusters two-dimensional data for unsupervised learning problems. Currently the program only works for K=2 and two-dimensional points, but I may create a more generalized version later if I have time.
