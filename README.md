# machineLearning

This repo is where I will store sample code for machine learning algorithms. These are simple examples, but the process of developing the programs is a great way to understand the mechanics of these learning approaches.

The Python **gradient boosting** program iteratively fits regression trees to the residuals of the base learner (in this case a one-dimensional spline).

The **K-means clustering** algorithm was written for R and clusters two-dimensional data for unsupervised learning problems. Currently the program only works for K=2, but I may develop a more generalized version later when I have more time.
